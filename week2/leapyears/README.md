# Leap Years
A simple tool that will tell you whether a year is a leap year, according to the following rules:

- All years divisible by 400 ARE leap years (e.g. 2000 was a leap year)
- All years divisible by 4 and not by 100 ARE leap years (e.g. 2004, 2008 and 2012 were leap years)
- All years divisible by 100 but not by 400 are NOT leap years (e.g. 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not leap years)
- All years not divisible by 4 are NOT leap years (e.g. 2009, 2010 and 2011 were not leap years)
