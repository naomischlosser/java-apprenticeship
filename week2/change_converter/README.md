# Change Converter
Given a number in pounds and pence, work out the most efficient way of breaking it down into notes and coins, e.g. `11.55` becomes `["£10", "£1", "50p", "5p"]`

Written in Java using IntelliJ IDEA.

## Extensions
- Write a program that takes an array of note and coin values and returns the result of summing these amounts, in `£00.00` format.
- Write a change generator for a different currency e.g. USD.
- Turn you change converter into a cash machine, but preloading it with notes and change. Keep track of how much money it has dispensed, and notify the user when it runs out.
