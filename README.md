# Java Apprenticeship
A 3 week bootcamp to learn Java.

## Week 1 - Java Fundamentals
The first week is designed to write and execute basic Java programs, and also learn about some important things such as how to use types and how to write tests using JUnit. After doing some basic exercises, I then build a more complex program (a CLI game) using object-oriented Java features.
